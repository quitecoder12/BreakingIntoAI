Day 2 of my AI Engineering roadmap is all about understanding Python and its core.

## Phase 1 : Day -2

### Focus: Python core & first programs

Here are what I Tackled today:

* Python syntax
    
* Data Types
    
* Operators
    
* Conditional Statements
    
* Loops
    

Python is a powerful, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple paradigms and is widely used in web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, and more. Its rich ecosystem and strong community make it highly popular.

## Python Syntax

Python has some simple & readable syntax with few essential rules, which we have to follow. Here are the key syntax rules:

1. ### Case Sensitivity
    
2. ### Indentation
    
3. Comments
    
4. Variables & Assignments
    
5. Keywords & Identifiers
    
6. Statements & Line Breaks
    
7. Quotes for Strings
    
8. Input & Output
    
9. Functions
