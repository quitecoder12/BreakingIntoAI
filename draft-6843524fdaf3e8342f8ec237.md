## Python Syntax

Python has some simple & readable syntax with few essential rules, which we have to follow. Here are the key syntax rules:

1. **Case Sensitivity**
    
    Python is **case-sensitive** language**,** meaning ***Name***, ***name*** and ***NAME*** are treated as three distinct identifiers.  
    *Example*:
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749369285324/e763e74b-d325-4458-aaa3-4124164575c6.png align="left")
    
2. **Indentation**  
    **Indentation** is **mandatory** in Python and it defines the structure of code block, so inconsistent spacing can lead to syntax error and unexpected behavior. We can use **4 spaces per indentation level** or a **tab**. No need to use {} like other programming languages.  
    *Correct Indentation:*

    *Incorrect Indentation:*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749370235067/c2e5011e-da13-47d5-8446-fcde723d6b07.png align="left")
    
3. **Comments**  
    In Python, comments start with a # symbol and are used to explain code, making it easier to understand but ignored during execution. Single-line comments use # and multi-line comments use ‘“““ “““ or ‘‘‘ ‘‘‘.  
    *Example:*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749370721832/82fde02a-7fb6-41c9-884f-6be3787a77a7.png align="left")
    
4. **Variables & Assignments**  
    In Python, variables are used to **store data** and are created by simply assigning a value using the `=` operator, without needing to declare a type explicitly.  
    Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers or underscores.  
    *Example:*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749394130404/78e6f091-de21-4da6-b62b-dc828463f982.png align="left")
    
5. **Keywords & Identifiers**  
    In Python, **keywords** are reserved words that have special meaning (like `if`, `for`, `class`), while **identifiers** are the names we define for variables, functions, classes, etc., and must follow naming rules without conflicting with keywords.  
    *Example:*  
    ***\# Invalid: def = 5 (Error!)***
    
    ***\# Valid:***
    
    ***my\_def = 5***  
    To see all Python keywords:

    \['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield'\]  
    
6. **Statements & Line Breaks**  
    In Python, a **statement** is a single line of code that performs an action, and while each statement usually ends with a line break. Each statement usually goes on a **new line**. We can use `;` to write multiple statements in one line (but it is not recommended).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749396093179/4d484a8d-f393-4af6-8493-008220be9eba.png align="left")
    
    We can use `\` for line continuation.

7. **Quotes for Strings**  
    In Python, strings can be enclosed in **single (**`'`), **double** (`"`), or **triple quotes** (`'''` or `"""`), allowing flexibility for embedding quotes and creating multi-line strings.

8. **Input & Output**  
    In Python, **input** is taken from the user using the `input()` function, and **output** is displayed on the screen using the `print()` function.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749397144799/5254cb1b-bada-4347-9675-9086187cda6d.png align="left")
    
9. **Functions**  
    In Python, a **function** is a reusable block of code defined using the `def` keyword that performs a specific task and can be executed when called by its name.

## Python Data Types

1. **Numeric**  
    In Python, **numeric data types** include `int` for integers, `float` for decimal numbers, and `complex` for complex numbers, enabling a wide range of mathematical operations.  
      
    **int** - Integer (Whole numbers)  
    The **integer data type (**`int`) is used to represent whole numbers without a fractional component, such as `10`, `-42`, or `0`.  
    ***x = 10***  
      
    **float** - Floating Point (Decimal numbers)  
    The **float data type** represents real numbers with decimal points, such as `3.14`, `-0.001`, or `2.0`, allowing for precise fractional calculations.  
    ***pi = 3.14***  
      
    **complex** - Complex numbers  
    The **complex data type** is used to represent complex numbers in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part (e.g., `3 + 4j`).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749402662741/a4380c24-563c-41b9-ac81-cf19134e62e8.png align="left")
    
2. **Text**  
    The **text data type** is called `str` and is used to represent sequences of characters, such as words, sentences, or any textual data (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).  
    ***name = “John“  
    message = “Hello, World!“***  
    
3. **Boolean**  
    The **boolean data type** has two possible values: `True` and `False`, which are often used for conditional logic and control flow in programs.  
    ***is\_active = True  
    has\_permission = False***
    
4. **Sequence**  
    **Sequence data types** like `list`, `tuple`, and `range` are used to store collections of items in a specific order, allowing access via indexing and iteration.  
    The `list` is an ordered, changeable collection that can contain mixed data types and duplicates.  
    ***fruits = \["apple", "banana", "cherry"\]***  
      
    The tuple is a ordered, **immutable**, allows duplicates.  
    ***coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)***  
      
    The range represents a sequence of numbers commonly used for looping.  
    ***r = range(5)*** *\# 0 to 4*
    
    ***print(list(r))*** *\# \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\]*
    
5. **Mapping**  
    The **mapping data type** is represented by the `dict` (dictionary), which stores key-value pairs, allowing fast access to values using unique keys.  
    ***person = {"name": "Susan", "age": 30}***
    
6. **Set**  
    The **set data type** is an unordered collection of unique elements, useful for operations like union, intersection, and eliminating duplicates.  
    ***unique\_numbers = {1, 2, 3}***
    
7. **None**  
    The **set data type** is an unordered collection of unique elements, useful for operations like union, intersection, and eliminating duplicates.  
    ***x = None***

## Python Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators**  
    In Python, **arithmetic operators** are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulus (`%`), exponentiation (`**`), and floor division (`//`).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412255920/3fdfe12d-39ec-40a7-9202-2135b379ba37.png align="left")
    
2. **Assignment Operators**  
    **Assignment operators** are used to assign values to variables, with `=` for basic assignment and shorthand versions like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc., to update a variable's value based on its current value.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412288812/70e81e5d-376f-4be9-8bef-5c38f863c48c.png align="left")
    
3. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**  
    **Comparison operators** are used to compare two values and return a boolean result, including `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412809643/e33660dd-afee-42be-8db1-c10a6f70ae83.png align="center")
    
4. **Logical Operators**  
    **Logical operators** are used to combine conditional statements and return boolean results, including `and` (true if both are true), `or` (true if at least one is true), and `not` (inverts the result).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412819112/3706e6d4-f832-4dd4-8266-ac26c43fc8da.png align="center")
    
5. **Identity Operators**  
    **Identity operators** `is` and `is not` are used to compare whether two variables refer to the **same object in memory**, not just equal values.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412846812/e1c89e5a-988d-4b1d-8abc-7b425b2155af.png align="center")
    
6. **Membership Operators**  
    **Membership operators** `in` and `not in` are used to test whether a value exists within a sequence like a list, tuple, string, or dictionary.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749412866145/0c1b7f25-217e-4975-87c9-823dbfdfa256.png align="center")
    
7. **Bitwise Operators**  
    **Bitwise operators** perform operations on the binary representations of integers, including `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).
