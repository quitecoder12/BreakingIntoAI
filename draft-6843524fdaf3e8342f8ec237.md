Day 2 of my AI Engineering roadmap is all about understanding Python and its core.

## Phase 1 : Day -2

### Focus: Python core & first programs

Here are what I Tackled today:

* Python syntax
    
* Data Types
    
* Operators
    
* Conditional Statements
    
* Loops
    

Python is a powerful, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple paradigms and is widely used in web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, and more. Its rich ecosystem and strong community make it highly popular.

## Python Syntax

Python has some simple & readable syntax with few essential rules, which we have to follow. Here are the key syntax rules:

1. **Case Sensitivity**
    
    Python is **case-sensitive** language**,** meaning ***Name***, ***name*** and ***NAME*** are treated as three distinct identifiers.  
    *Example*:

2. **Indentation**  
    **Indentation** is **mandatory** in Python and it defines the structure of code block, so inconsistent spacing can lead to syntax error and unexpected behavior. We can use **4 spaces per indentation level** or a **tab**. No need to use {} like other programming languages.  
    *Correct Indentation:*

    *Incorrect Indentation:*

3. **Comments**  
    In Python, comments start with a # symbol and are used to explain code, making it easier to understand but ignored during execution. Single-line comments use # and multi-line comments use ‘“““ “““ or ‘‘‘ ‘‘‘.  
    *Example:*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749370721832/82fde02a-7fb6-41c9-884f-6be3787a77a7.png align="left")
    
4. **Variables & Assignments**  
    In Python, variables are used to **store data** and are created by simply assigning a value using the `=` operator, without needing to declare a type explicitly.  
    Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers or underscores.  
    *Example:*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749394130404/78e6f091-de21-4da6-b62b-dc828463f982.png align="left")
    
5. **Keywords & Identifiers**  
    
6. **Statements & Line Breaks**  
    fsfsd
    
7. **Quotes for Strings**  
    sdfsdf
    
8. **Input & Output**  
    xcvcv
    
9. **Functions**  
    cv
