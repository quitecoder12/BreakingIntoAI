From CodeIgniter to Artificial Intelligence - join me on my journey to become an AI Engineer.

My journey will be in 5 phases (The Roadmap).

* **Phase 1 - AI Engineer Foundation**  
    In this phase the goal is to learn Python fluently and get into the AI Engineering mindset.
    
* **Phase 2 - Machine Learning Kickstart**  
    In this phase the goal is to learn the core ML concepts and build some learning projects.
    
* **Phase 3 - Deep Learning & NLP Basics**  
    In this phase the goal is to learn to build AI-powered apps chat-bots, translators and more.
    
* **Phase 4 - Data Engineering + Real World AI Apps**  
    In this phase the goal is to learn how AI engineers work in production.
    
* **Phase 5 - Capstone Projects**  
    In this the goal is to build professional real world app and ship it out in the world.
    

## Phase 1 : Day -1

### Focus: Environment Setup and First Steps in Python

As an experienced web developer, transitioning into AI feels exciting but sometimes a bit scary.

Today, I started Phase 1 of my Roadmap to becoming an AI Engineer.

## What I Did

### Installed My AI Dev Stack

1. Python 3.12.2  
    I downloaded the Python from its [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and installed it on my laptop.

2. Visual Studio Code extensions - **Python** & **Jupyter**  
    I have been using VS Code for several years now. You can download it for free from its [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749217917143/b8e544ae-c6d1-422e-b50f-c382e73161a5.png align="center")
    
    After installing VS Code, open the application. Then go to **View** &gt; **Extensions** option.

    In the Extensions sidebar search box, lets type **Python.** When the extension appears, click **Install** button. Similarly we can install **Jupyter** extension.

    Note: When you first run a Jupyter notebook, VS Code will ask for your permission to install the **ipykernel** package before running it.
    
3. Virtual Environment  
    It is a Python environment, that is self-contained directory which includes.
    
    * A Python interpreter
        
    * Set of installed package/libraries
        
    * Their versions of packages/libraries can differ for different projects
        
    * It is a Python environment, that is self-contained directory which includes.  
          
        Create using **venv** (recommended)  
        **Step 1: Check if Python is installed**  
        Run the following command to verify that Python is installed:  
        ***python --version***
        
        ***python3 --version*** *(for mac)*
        
    * ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749225393102/9829b6d3-2b7b-4784-8d64-5345d45c97c8.png align="center")
        
        We need to make sure the Python version is 3.6 or higher.  
        
        **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**  
        Run the following command in your project folder:  
        ***python -m venv &lt;env name&gt;***
        
        ***python3 -m venv &lt;env name&gt;*** *(for mac)*
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749227093062/ea7de4b0-41f8-4187-aca0-478b7506fe01.png align="center")
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749227177554/24f12f25-0a4f-45d9-a880-9f831127c090.png align="center")
        
        In the screenshot above, you can see a folder in the left panel with the same name as your virtual environment.  
          
        **Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment**  
        In Windows CMD or Powershell  
        ***&lt;env name&gt;\\Scripts\\activate***  
        In Mac/Linux  
        ***source &lt;env name&gt;/bin/activate***
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749228992506/ecdd5054-98d8-4c9d-9279-17de2478eb52.png align="center")
        
        When the environment is activated, you will see the environment name in brackets (refer to the screenshot above).  
          
        **Step 4: Install Required Packages**  
        Once the environment is activated, you can install dependencies using the following command.  
        ***pip install package\_name***  
        Example:  
        ***pip install panda numpy***  
          
        **Step 5: List Installed Packages**  
        To view all the installed packages in the virtual environment  
        ***pip list***

        **Step 6: Deactivate the Environment**  
        To exit the virtual environment when done  
        ***deactivate***
